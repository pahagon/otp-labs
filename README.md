# OTP Labs

OTP Labs is a demo application built with Elixir and OTP to show how to integrate
Distributed Elixir on Kubernetes with Horde, LibCluster, and Distillery. 

## Horde
Distribute your application over multiple servers with Horde.

You should use Horde when you want a global supervisor (or global registry, or some combination of the two) 
that supports automatic fail-over, dynamic cluster membership, and graceful node shutdown.
